        Scenario: A sync job is interrupted. The state is saved with `currently_syncing`.
                  The next sync job kicks off and the tap picks back up on that
                  `currently_syncing` stream.

        Expected State Structure:
            {
                "currently_syncing": "stream_name",
                "bookmarks": {

                }
            }

        Test Cases:
        - Verify an interrupted sync can resume based on the `currently_syncing` and
            stream level bookmark value.
        - Verify only records with replication-key values greater than or equal to the
            stream level bookmark are replicated on the resuming sync for the interrupted stream.
        - Verify the yet-to-be-synced streams are replicated following the interrupted stream
            in the resuming sync.
